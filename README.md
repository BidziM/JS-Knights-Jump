# JS-Knights-Jump

Create a function that takes a square where a knight jumps from as a string and returns all the possible squares the knight can land on as a string. Ignore capturing and further Chess rules. Be aware of the sides of the board. Knights don't go over the edge, obviously.

Example:
knightsJump("A1") âžž "C2,B3"
